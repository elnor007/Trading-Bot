Developed a trading bot using the MetaTrader5 Python API. The algorithm aims to place pending orders which are equally spaced from one another and also ensures that each order 
is placed at a unique price point. The amount of space between orders can be set at the start of the code.

Also contains many useful functions which automate tedious manual tasks, such as: Closing all the trades, calculating total profit made over x amount of hours, modifying the take profit/stop loss of all open trades, and many more.

In order to run this, you must download the MetaTrader5 application and the MT5 python library. You also need a stock exchange account compatible with MT5 (I used OANDA). I will soon upload a video to showcase what this code does.
